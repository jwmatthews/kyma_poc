    "# JMS to Reactive example with HelloWorld-MDB and CoolStuff Store\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "We will use 2 sample applications for this example.  Both of them have an original branch which represents their starting point as a Java EE application and then another branch for their end result of being migrated to Quarkus.  \n",
    "## What are we doing?\n",
    "* We will run a source code analysis on both sample applications original state as a Java EE app\n",
    "* We will attempt to modernize the 'Cool Stuff Store' JavaEE branch to Quarkus by:\n",
    "    * Use the static code analysis as guides of what changes need to be made to what files\n",
    "    * Combine the static code analysis incidents with a sample of how these issues were solved in the 'Hello World MDB' Quarkus branch.\n",
    "        * The intent is to use what was done in 'Hello World MDB' Quarkus branch to heavily influence how the LLM solves a similar issue with 'Cool Stuff Store'\n",
    "## Sample App Information\n",
    "### Hello World MDB\n",
    "* This example started from JBoss EAP Quickstarts: https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/tree/7.4.x/helloworld-mdb/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/mdb\n",
