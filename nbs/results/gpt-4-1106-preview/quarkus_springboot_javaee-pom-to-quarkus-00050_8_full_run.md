## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Adopt Maven Failsafe plugin


## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Use the Maven Failsafe plugin adding the following sections to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <properties>. <surefire-plugin.version>3.0.0</compiler-plugin.version>. </properties>. <build>. <plugins>. <plugin>. <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>. <version>$</version>. <executions>. <execution>. <goals>. <goals>integration-test</goal>. <goals>verify</goal>. </goals>. <configuration>. <systemPropertyVariables>. <native.image.path>$/$-runner</native.image.path>. <java.util.logging.manager>org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</java.util.logging.manager>. <maven.home>$</maven.home>. </systemPropertyVariables>. </configuration>. </execution>. </executions>. </plugin>. </plugins>. </build>. ```

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Since there is no 'Current Source Code' provided for the `pom.xml` file, I will assume that we are starting with a basic Maven `pom.xml` file for a Java EE application that does not yet include the Maven Failsafe plugin configuration. The task is to add the Maven Failsafe plugin to enable integration testing, particularly for a Quarkus application.

The Maven Failsafe plugin is used during the integration-test and verify phases of the Maven lifecycle to execute integration tests. These tests are typically run separately from unit tests, which are handled by the Maven Surefire plugin.

The message provided indicates that we should add the Maven Failsafe plugin with specific configuration for Quarkus, including setting system properties that are relevant for Quarkus applications, such as the path to the native image and the logging manager.

Here are the steps to update the `pom.xml`:

1. Add the `<properties>` section to define the version of the Maven Failsafe plugin.
2. Add the `<build>` section if it does not exist.
3. Within the `<build>` section, add the `<plugins>` section if it does not exist.
4. Add the `maven-failsafe-plugin` configuration within the `<plugins>` section.
5. Set the version of the plugin using the property defined in step 1.
6. Define the `<executions>` section with goals for `integration-test` and `verify`.
7. Configure the `<systemPropertyVariables>` to include properties specific to Quarkus.

Here is the updated `pom.xml` in diff format:

```diff

+                                 <maven.home>${maven.home}</maven.home>
+                             </systemPropertyVariables>
+                         </configuration>
+                     </execution>
+                 </executions>
+             </plugin>
+             <!-- Other plugins -->
+         </plugins>
+     </build>
+ 
+     <!-- Other configurations -->
+ 
+ </project>
```

Please note that the `${project.build.directory}` and `${project.artifactId}` placeholders are used to dynamically set the path to the native image, which is typically named `<artifactId>-runner`. The `${maven.home}` placeholder is used to set the Maven home directory.

The version of the Maven Failsafe plugin is set using a property `surefire-plugin.version`, which is defined in the `<properties>` section. This allows for easy management of the plugin version from a single location.

The `org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager` is specified as the logging manager because Quarkus uses JBoss Log Manager by default.

Remember to replace the placeholders and add any additional configurations that are specific to your project's setup.
