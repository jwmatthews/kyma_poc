## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Adopt Maven Surefire plugin


## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Use the Maven Surefire plugin adding the following sections to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <properties>. <surefire-plugin.version>3.0.0</compiler-plugin.version>. </properties>. <build>. <plugins>. <plugin>. <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>. <version>$</version>. <configuration>. <systemPropertyVariables>. <java.util.logging.manager>org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</java.util.logging.manager>. <maven.home>$</maven.home>. </systemPropertyVariables>. </configuration>. </plugin>. </plugins>. </build>. ```

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Since there is no 'Current Source Code' provided for the `pom.xml` file, I will assume that we are starting from scratch or that the existing `pom.xml` does not contain any configuration related to the Maven Surefire plugin. The task is to add the Maven Surefire plugin to the `pom.xml` file with the specified configuration to ensure that the application's tests are executed correctly in a Quarkus environment.

The Maven Surefire plugin is used during the `test` phase of the build lifecycle to execute the unit tests of an application. It is important to configure it correctly to ensure that the tests run with the appropriate settings for the Quarkus environment.

The message from the static code analysis tool suggests adding specific properties and configurations for the Surefire plugin. The `<java.util.logging.manager>` system property is set to `org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager` to ensure that the logging is handled correctly by the JBoss LogManager, which is used by Quarkus.

The `<maven.home>` system property is also set, which can be useful for the plugin to know the Maven installation directory, although in many cases this might not be necessary.

Here is the updated `pom.xml` file with the Maven Surefire plugin configuration:

```diff
+ <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
+          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
+          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
+     <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
+
+     <!-- Other configurations like groupId, artifactId, version, etc. -->
+
+     <properties>
+         <surefire-plugin.version>3.0.0</surefire-plugin.version>
+         <!-- Other properties -->
+     </properties>
+
+     <build>
+         <plugins>
+             <plugin>
+                 <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
+                 <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
+                 <version>${surefire-plugin.version}</version>
+                 <configuration>
+                     <systemPropertyVariables>
+                         <java.util.logging.manager>org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</java.util.logging.manager>
+                         <maven.home>${maven.home}</maven.home>
+                     </systemPropertyVariables>
+                 </configuration>
+             </plugin>
+             <!-- Other plugins -->
+         </plugins>
+     </build>
+
+     <!-- Other configurations -->
+
+ </project>
```

Please note that the `groupId` for the Maven Surefire plugin is not specified in the message from the static code analysis tool, but it is typically `org.apache.maven.plugins`. Also, the placeholder `$` for the version in the message should be replaced with the property `${surefire-plugin.version}` which is defined in the `<properties>` section.

If there are other configurations in the existing `pom.xml` file, they should be merged with the above changes carefully to avoid conflicts. If there are any specific configurations or dependencies related to the legacy Java EE application that are not compatible with Quarkus, those would need to be addressed separately.
