## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Replace the 'flyway-core' dependency with Quarkus 'quarkus-flyway' extension
Replace the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency with the Quarkus dependency `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway`. Further information in the link below.

## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Replace the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency with the Quarkus dependency `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway`. Further information in the link below.

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Since the 'Current Source Code' section for the `pom.xml` file is empty, I will provide a general explanation of what changes would be necessary if the `pom.xml` contained the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency, and then I will write the updated `pom.xml` snippet in the form of a diff.

When migrating a Java EE application to Quarkus, it is important to replace dependencies that are not optimized for Quarkus with their Quarkus-specific counterparts. This ensures that the application can take full advantage of the optimizations and features provided by Quarkus, such as reduced startup time, lower memory footprint, and native compilation support.

In this case, the static code analysis tool has identified that the application is using the `flyway-core` dependency, which is not optimized for Quarkus. The recommended action is to replace it with the `quarkus-flyway` extension, which is a Quarkus-specific integration for Flyway.

Here are the steps to update the `pom.xml`:

1. Remove the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency.
2. Add the `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway` dependency.

The `quarkus-flyway` extension will automatically integrate with Quarkus and provide the necessary configurations and optimizations for using Flyway in a Quarkus application.

Here is the `pom.xml` diff that shows the necessary changes:

```diff
<dependencies>
-   <!-- Remove the legacy Flyway dependency -->
-   <dependency>
-       <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
-       <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
-       <version>YOUR_FLYWAY_VERSION</version>
-   </dependency>
+   <!-- Add the Quarkus Flyway extension -->
+   <dependency>
+       <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
+       <artifactId>quarkus-flyway</artifactId>
+   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Please note that you should replace `YOUR_FLYWAY_VERSION` with the actual version number that was used in your `pom.xml`. Also, the Quarkus Flyway extension will manage its own version of Flyway, so you do not need to specify a version for `quarkus-flyway` when using the Quarkus BOM (Bill of Materials).

If there are any Flyway-specific configurations in the application properties or code, they may need to be updated to match the Quarkus configuration properties. However, without specific code examples or configurations, I cannot provide detailed instructions on those changes. If you have any Flyway configurations that you are unsure about how to migrate, please provide them, and I can give more targeted advice.
