## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: `beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored
`beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored and it could be removed from the application.. Refer to the guide referenced below to check the supported CDI feature in Quarkus.

## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
`beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored and it could be removed from the application.. Refer to the guide referenced below to check the supported CDI feature in Quarkus.

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/beans.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
In the context of migrating a legacy Java EE application to Quarkus, the `beans.xml` file is used to configure CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) behavior. In traditional Java EE applications, `beans.xml` may contain bean-discovery modes, interceptors, decorators, alternatives, and other CDI configurations.

Quarkus, however, has a different approach to CDI configuration. It aims to simplify the configuration process and reduce boilerplate. Quarkus does support a subset of the features that can be configured in `beans.xml`, but many of the configurations are either unnecessary or can be achieved through annotations or properties in the `application.properties` file.

Given that the static code analysis tool has indicated that the `beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored and could be removed from the application, it suggests that the CDI features used in the legacy application are either implicitly supported by Quarkus or can be configured differently.

Since the 'Current Source Code' section for `beans.xml` is empty (i.e., `None`), it implies that there is no specific configuration within `beans.xml` that needs to be migrated. Therefore, the action to take is to remove the `beans.xml` file from the Quarkus application, as it is not necessary and its content is ignored.

Here is the diff showing the removal of `beans.xml`:

```diff
- src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/beans.xml
```

This diff indicates that the file `src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/beans.xml` should be deleted from the project structure.

Explanation of the changes:

- **Removal of `beans.xml`**: Since Quarkus does not require `beans.xml` for CDI configuration and the static code analysis tool has indicated that it is ignored, the file can be safely removed. This simplifies the project structure and aligns with Quarkus' philosophy of reducing unnecessary configuration.

If there were specific configurations within `beans.xml` that needed to be migrated, we would look at those configurations and determine how to translate them into Quarkus' configuration model, either through annotations, properties, or programmatic CDI APIs. However, since the file content is `None`, no such migration is necessary.

It is also worth noting that if the application does require any CDI configuration that was previously done in `beans.xml`, developers should refer to the Quarkus CDI guide to understand how to achieve the same functionality using Quarkus' model. This might involve using annotations like `@Alternative`, `@Priority`, or adding configuration properties in `application.properties`.
