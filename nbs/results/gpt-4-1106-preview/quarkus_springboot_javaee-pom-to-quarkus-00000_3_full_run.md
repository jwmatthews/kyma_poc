## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: The expected project artifact's extension is `jar`


## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
The project artifact's current extension (i.e. `<packaging>` tag value) is `` but the expected value should be `jar`

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Since the 'Current Source Code' section for the `pom.xml` file is empty, I will provide a general explanation of what changes would typically be needed to update a legacy Java EE application's Maven project file (`pom.xml`) to be compatible with Quarkus, and then I will provide a sample `pom.xml` diff that reflects these changes.

In a typical Java EE application, the `pom.xml` file may have a `<packaging>` element with a value other than `jar`, such as `war` or `ear`, which are common for enterprise applications. Quarkus, however, is designed to work with a `jar` packaging to create a standalone Java application that can be run with `java -jar`.

Here are the steps you would take to update the `pom.xml`:

1. Change the `<packaging>` element to `jar` if it is not already set to `jar`.
2. Add Quarkus dependencies and the Quarkus Maven plugin to the project.
3. Remove or replace any dependencies that are not compatible with Quarkus.
4. Update any plugin configurations that may conflict with Quarkus.

Since we do not have the original `pom.xml` content, I will assume that the `<packaging>` element is set to something other than `jar` and that we need to add the Quarkus dependencies and plugin. Here is a sample diff for a hypothetical `pom.xml`:

```

This diff assumes that we are starting from scratch. If the original `pom.xml` file had content, you would need to modify the existing elements accordingly. The key points are setting the packaging to `jar`, adding the Quarkus BOM (Bill of Materials) and dependencies, and configuring the Quarkus Maven plugin. The versions of Quarkus used in the properties section should be the latest stable versions available at the time of the migration.
