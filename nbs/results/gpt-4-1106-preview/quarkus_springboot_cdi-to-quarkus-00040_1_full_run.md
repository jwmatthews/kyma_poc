## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Producer annotation no longer required
In Quarkus, you can skip the @Produces annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier... This field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.

## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
In Quarkus, you can skip the @Produces annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier... This field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/utils/Producers.java
```
  1  package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;
  2  
  3  import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
  4  import javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
  5  import java.util.logging.Logger;
  6  
  7  
  8  public class Producers {
  9  
 10      Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());
 11  
 12      @Produces
 13      public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
 14          return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
 15      }
 16  
 17  }

```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Based on the information provided and the message from the static code analysis tool, we need to update the `Producers.java` class to work with Quarkus. The tool indicates that the `@Produces` annotation is no longer required if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. Additionally, it suggests that the field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.

In the context of Quarkus, CDI beans are automatically discovered, and the `@Produces` annotation is typically used to disambiguate the type of bean being produced, especially when there are multiple implementations. However, if we use a qualifier or a scope annotation, Quarkus can infer the bean type without the need for `@Produces`.

In the current source code, the `produceLog` method is annotated with `@Produces` to indicate that it produces a `Logger` instance for injection. Since we want to update this to Quarkus, we can remove the `@Produces` annotation and instead use a qualifier or a scope annotation. In this case, we can use `@ApplicationScoped` to indicate that the `Logger` produced should be application-scoped. This means that the same `Logger` instance will be used throughout the application.

Additionally, we can use the `@Named` annotation to provide a name for the bean, which can then be used for injection elsewhere in the application. However, since the `Logger` is being produced for a specific injection point, it might not be necessary to name it unless we have a specific use case for it.

Here is the updated Quarkus source code for `Producers.java`:

```diff
  1  package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;
  2  
  3  -import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
  4  import javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
  5  import java.util.logging.Logger;
  6  +import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
  7  
  8  public class Producers {
  9  
 10      Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());
 11  
 12      -@Produces
 13      +@ApplicationScoped
 14      public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
 15          return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
 16      }
 17  
 18  }
```

In this update, I have:

- Removed the `@Produces` annotation from the `produceLog` method.
- Added the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to indicate that the `Logger` instance should be application-scoped.

This change should be sufficient for Quarkus to correctly manage the production of `Logger` instances for injection points throughout the application. If there are other producer methods in the application that require updates, a similar approach can be taken by removing the `@Produces` annotation and adding an appropriate scope annotation or qualifier.
