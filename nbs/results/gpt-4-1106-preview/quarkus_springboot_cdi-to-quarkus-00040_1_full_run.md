## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Producer annotation no longer required
In Quarkus, you can skip the @Produces annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier... This field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.

## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
In Quarkus, you can skip the @Produces annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier... This field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/utils/Producers.java
```
  1  package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;
  2  
  3  import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
  4  import javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
  5  import java.util.logging.Logger;
  6  
  7  
  8  public class Producers {
  9  
 10      Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());
 11  
 12      @Produces
 13      public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
 14          return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
 15      }
 16  
 17  }

```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Based on the information provided and the static code analysis tool's message, we need to update the legacy Java EE application code to be compatible with Quarkus. The message indicates that the `@Produces` annotation is no longer required if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. Additionally, the field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.

In the current source code, we have a producer method `produceLog` that uses the `@Produces` annotation to create a `Logger` instance. To update this code for Quarkus, we can remove the `@Produces` annotation and instead use a scope annotation. Since `Logger` is a dependent object and does not need to be application scoped, we can use the `@Dependent` scope annotation which is the default scope in CDI and does not need to be explicitly declared.

However, if we want to make it clear that the `Logger` is dependent on the injection point, we can explicitly annotate the producer method with `@Dependent`. Additionally, we can remove the unused `log` field in the `Producers` class as it is not being used anywhere in the provided snippet.

Here is the updated Quarkus source code in the form of a diff:

```diff
  1  package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;
  2  
  3  -import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
  4  import javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
  5  import java.util.logging.Logger;
  6  
  7  
  8  public class Producers {
  9  
-10      Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());
 11  
-12      @Produces
+12      @Dependent
 13      public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
 14          return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
 15      }
 16  
 17  }
```

The `@Dependent` annotation is not strictly necessary because it is the default scope, but I included it for clarity. If you prefer to rely on the default behavior, you can omit the `@Dependent` annotation entirely.

Please note that the `@Named` annotation mentioned in the static code analysis tool's message is not used here because we are not exposing the `Logger` instance for EL (Expression Language) resolution in JSF (JavaServer Faces) or similar contexts. If we needed to expose it for such purposes, we would add the `@Named` annotation with an appropriate name to the producer method.
