## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Adopt Quarkus BOM


## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Use the Quarkus BOM to omit the version of the different Quarkus dependencies.. Add the following sections to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <properties>. <quarkus.platform.artifact-id>quarkus-bom</quarkus.platform.artifact-id>. <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus.platform</quarkus.platform.group-id>. <quarkus.platform.version>3.1.0.Final</quarkus.platform.version>. </properties>. <dependencyManagement>. <dependencies>. <dependency>. <groupId>$</groupId>. <artifactId>$</artifactId>. <version>$</version>. <type>pom</type>. <scope>import</scope>. </dependency>. </dependencies>. </dependencyManagement>. ```. Check the latest Quarkus version available from the `Quarkus - Releases` link below.

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Since there is no 'Example Original Source Code' and 'Example Updated Source Code' provided, I will guide you through the process of updating a legacy Java EE application's `pom.xml` to use Quarkus based on the message provided by the static code analysis tool.

The message indicates that we should use the Quarkus Bill of Materials (BOM) to manage the versions of Quarkus dependencies. The BOM is a special kind of `pom.xml` that contains a list of dependencies and their versions that are tested and work well together. By importing the Quarkus BOM in our project, we can omit specifying versions for Quarkus dependencies in our `pom.xml`, as they will be provided by the BOM.

Here are the steps we need to take:

1. Add Quarkus BOM properties to the `<properties>` section of the `pom.xml`.
2. Import the Quarkus BOM in the `<dependencyManagement>` section of the `pom.xml`.

The message also suggests checking the latest Quarkus version available. It's important to use the latest stable version for the benefits of the latest features and bug fixes. However, for the purpose of this example, we will use the version provided in the message (`3.1.0.Final`).

Now, let's write the updated `pom.xml` in the form of a diff. Since we don't have the original `pom.xml`, I will assume that the `pom.xml` does not contain any Quarkus BOM configuration and will show you how to add it.

```diff
+ <properties>
+     <quarkus.platform.artifact-id>quarkus-bom</quarkus.platform.artifact-id>
+     <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus.platform</quarkus.platform.group-id>
+     <quarkus.platform.version>3.1.0.Final</quarkus.platform.version>
+ </properties>
+ 
+ <dependencyManagement>
+     <dependencies>
+         <dependency>
+             <groupId>${quarkus.platform.group-id}</groupId>
+             <artifactId>${quarkus.platform.artifact-id}</artifactId>
+             <version>${quarkus.platform.version}</version>
+             <type>pom</type>
+             <scope>import</scope>
+         </dependency>
+     </dependencies>
+ </dependencyManagement>
```

By adding these sections to the `pom.xml`, we are effectively instructing Maven to manage our Quarkus dependencies using the versions specified in the Quarkus BOM. This will help to ensure that all Quarkus dependencies are compatible with each other and reduce the risk of version conflicts.

Remember to replace the version with the latest stable version if it's different from `3.1.0.Final`. You can find the latest version on the Quarkus website or in the Maven Central repository.
