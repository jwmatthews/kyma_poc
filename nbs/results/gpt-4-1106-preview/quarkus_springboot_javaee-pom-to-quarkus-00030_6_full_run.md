## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Adopt Maven Compiler plugin


## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Use the Maven Compiler plugin adding the following sections to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <properties>. <compiler-plugin.version>3.10.1</compiler-plugin.version>. <maven.compiler.release>11</maven.compiler.release>. </properties>. <build>. <plugins>. <plugin>. <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>. <version>$</version>. <configuration>. <compilerArgs>. <arg>-parameters</arg>. </compilerArgs>. </configuration>. </plugin>. </plugins>. </build>. ```

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Since there is no 'Example Original Source Code' and 'Example Updated Source Code' provided, I will proceed with the instructions given in the 'Message' to update the 'Current Source Code' which is the `pom.xml` file for a legacy Java EE application to be compatible with Quarkus.

The Maven Compiler plugin is essential for compiling Java code. The message indicates that we should specify the version of the Maven Compiler plugin and the Java version to use for compilation. Additionally, we should enable the `-parameters` compiler argument to preserve parameter names at runtime, which is useful for frameworks that rely on reflection, such as Quarkus.

Here are the steps to update the `pom.xml`:

1. Add the `properties` section to define the version of the Maven Compiler plugin and the Java release version.
2. Add the `build` section with the `plugins` subsection.
3. Inside the `plugins` subsection, add the `maven-compiler-plugin` with the specified version and configuration.
4. The `$` in the `<version>$</version>` seems to be a placeholder. Replace it with the actual version number specified in the `properties` section.

The updated `pom.xml` will look like this:

```diff
+ <project xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"
+          xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
+          xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">
+     <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
+
+     <!-- Other configurations like groupId, artifactId, version, etc. -->
+
+     <properties>
+         <compiler-plugin.version>3.10.1</compiler-plugin.version>
+         <maven.compiler.release>11</maven.compiler.release>
+     </properties>
+
+     <build>
+         <plugins>
+             <plugin>
+                 <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
+                 <version>${compiler-plugin.version}</version>
+                 <configuration>
+                     <release>${maven.compiler.release}</release>
+                     <compilerArgs>
+                         <arg>-parameters</arg>
+                     </compilerArgs>
+                 </configuration>
+             </plugin>
+         </plugins>
+     </build>
+ </project>
```

Please note that the above diff assumes that the `pom.xml` file is empty or does not contain any of the necessary Maven Compiler plugin configurations. If the `pom.xml` file already contains some configuration, you would need to modify the diff accordingly to integrate the new settings without duplicating or conflicting with existing configurations.
