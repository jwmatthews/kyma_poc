## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Replace the 'flyway-core' dependency with Quarkus 'quarkus-flyway' extension
Replace the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency with the Quarkus dependency `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway`. Further information in the link below.

## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Replace the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency with the Quarkus dependency `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway`. Further information in the link below.

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Since the 'Current Source Code' section for the `pom.xml` file is empty, I will provide a general explanation of what changes would be needed if the `pom.xml` contained the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency, and then I will show how to update the `pom.xml` to include the Quarkus `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway` extension.

The `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` is a standalone dependency used for database migrations. When migrating a Java EE application to Quarkus, it is recommended to use Quarkus extensions wherever possible because they are optimized for Quarkus and GraalVM, which can lead to a reduction in the size of the artifact and improved startup time.

To replace the `flyway-core` dependency with the Quarkus `quarkus-flyway` extension, you would need to:

1. Remove the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency from the `pom.xml`.
2. Add the `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway` dependency to the `pom.xml`.
3. Ensure that any Flyway configurations in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file are updated to the Quarkus configuration properties if they differ.

Here is how you would update the `pom.xml` file in Markdown format:

```diff
<dependencies>
-   <!-- Remove the old Flyway core dependency -->
-   <dependency>
-       <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
-       <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
-       <version>YOUR_FLYWAY_VERSION</version>
-   </dependency>
+   <!-- Add the Quarkus Flyway extension -->
+   <dependency>
+       <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
+       <artifactId>quarkus-flyway</artifactId>
+   </dependency>
</dependencies>
```

Please note that the version tag for the Quarkus dependency is not included. This is because when using the Quarkus BOM (Bill of Materials), you don't need to specify the version of Quarkus extensions; the BOM will manage the versions for you.

If there are any Flyway-specific configurations in your `application.properties` or `application.yml`, you would need to ensure they are updated to the Quarkus configuration keys. For example, if you have properties like `flyway.url`, `flyway.user`, and `flyway.password`, you would update them to the Quarkus configuration keys, which are typically prefixed with `quarkus.flyway`.

Since there is no actual `pom.xml` content provided, I cannot give a precise diff. If you can provide the specific content of the `pom.xml` file, I could give a more accurate diff.
