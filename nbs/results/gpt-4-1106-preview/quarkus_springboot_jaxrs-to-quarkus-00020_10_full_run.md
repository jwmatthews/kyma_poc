## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary
JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary. You can set a root path like this but you don't have to.

## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/rest/RestApplication.java
```
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;


@ApplicationPath("/services")
public class RestApplication extends Application {

}

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/rest/RestApplication.java
```
package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;

import jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;


@ApplicationPath("/services")
public class RestApplication extends Application {

}

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary. You can set a root path like this but you don't have to.

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/rest/RestApplication.java
```
  1  package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;
  2  
  3  import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
  4  import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
  5  
  6  
  7  @ApplicationPath("/services")
  8  public class RestApplication extends Application {
  9  
 10  }

```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
The example provided shows a change from the `javax` namespace to the `jakarta` namespace. This change is part of the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE, which is the direction that Quarkus has adopted. Quarkus uses the Jakarta EE APIs for JAX-RS instead of the older Java EE APIs.

However, the message indicates that JAX-RS activation is no longer necessary in Quarkus. This means that extending the `Application` class and annotating it with `@ApplicationPath` is optional in Quarkus. Quarkus automatically detects JAX-RS resources and providers without the need for an application class.

Given this information, we can simplify the code by removing the `RestApplication` class entirely. Quarkus will serve JAX-RS resources under the default path `/`, but if we want to maintain the `/services` path prefix, we can set this in the `application.properties` file instead.

Here are the steps to update the code:

1. Remove the `RestApplication` class, as it is not needed for Quarkus.
2. If we want to maintain the `/services` path prefix, add the `quarkus.resteasy.path=/services` property to the `application.properties` file.

Here is the updated Quarkus source code in the form of a diff:

```diff
  1  package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;
  2  
  3 -import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
  4 -import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
  5  
  6 -@ApplicationPath("/services")
  7 -public class RestApplication extends Application {
  8 -  
  9 -}
```

And in the `src/main/resources/application.properties` file (if maintaining the `/services` path prefix):

```properties
quarkus.resteasy.path=/services
```

By making these changes, we align the application with Quarkus' approach to JAX-RS and simplify the codebase by removing unnecessary parts.
