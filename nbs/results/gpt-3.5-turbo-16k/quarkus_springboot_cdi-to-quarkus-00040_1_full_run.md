## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Producer annotation no longer required
In Quarkus, you can skip the @Produces annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier... This field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.

## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
In Quarkus, you can skip the @Produces annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier... This field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/utils/Producers.java
```
  1  package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;
  2  
  3  import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
  4  import javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
  5  import java.util.logging.Logger;
  6  
  7  
  8  public class Producers {
  9  
 10      Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());
 11  
 12      @Produces
 13      public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
 14          return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
 15      }
 16  
 17  }

```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
The current source code is a Java class named `Producers` located in the package `com.redhat.coolstore.utils`. This class contains a method `produceLog` that is annotated with `@Produces`. The method returns an instance of `Logger` and takes an `InjectionPoint` as a parameter.

To update this code to work correctly with Quarkus, we need to remove the `@Produces` annotation from the method and replace it with a `@Named` annotation on the getter method. This will allow Quarkus to automatically inject the `Logger` instance without the need for the `@Produces` annotation.

Here are the steps to update the code:

1. Remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `produceLog` method.
2. Add a `@Named` annotation on the getter method `getLog()`.
3. Update the return type of the `getLog()` method to `Logger`.
4. Remove the `InjectionPoint` parameter from the `getLog()` method.

The updated code will look like this:

```diff
 1  package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;
 2  
 3  import javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
 4  import javax.inject.Named;
 5  import java.util.logging.Logger;
 6  
 7  
 8  public class Producers {
 9  
10      Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());
11  
12-     @Produces
13-     public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
14-         return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
15-     }
16+     @Named
17+     public Logger getLog() {
18+         return Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());
19+     }
20  
21  }
```

In the updated code, we have removed the `@Produces` annotation from the `produceLog` method and added a `@Named` annotation on the `getLog()` method. We have also removed the `InjectionPoint` parameter from the `getLog()` method as it is no longer needed. The return type of the `getLog()` method has been changed to `Logger`.
