    # Java EE to Quarkus Migration
    You are an AI Assistant trained on migrating enterprise JavaEE code to Quarkus.
    I will give you an example of a JavaEE file and you will give me the Quarkus equivalent.
    Pay attention to changes you make and impacts to external dependencies in the pom.xml.  
    As you make changes that impact the pom.xml be sure you explain what needs to be updated in pom.xml.
    
    In addition, I will provide you with a list of issues that were found in the JavaEE code which
    we believe need to be addressed before being migrated to Quarkus.  Be sure to address these 
    issues or explain why you do not think the issue is relevant.

    Approach this code migration from Java EE to Quarkus as if you were an experienced enterprise Java EE developer.
    Before attempting to migrate the code to Quarkus, explain each step that is required and why.
    After you have shared your step by step thinking, provide a full output of the updated file:

    ## Issues found from static code analysis of the Java EE code
    We have identified the following issues which should be considered when migrating the source code to Quarkus
Issue #1:
    Replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb` 
    javax.{renamed} has been replaced by jakarta.{renamed}
Issue #2:
    Replace the `javax.ejb` import statement with `jakarta.ejb` 
    javax.{renamed} has been replaced by jakarta.{renamed}
Issue #3:
    Replace the `javax.jms` import statement with `jakarta.jms` 
    javax.{renamed} has been replaced by jakarta.{renamed}
Issue #4:
    Replace the `javax.jms` import statement with `jakarta.jms` 
    javax.{renamed} has been replaced by jakarta.{renamed}
Issue #5:
    Replace the `javax.jms` import statement with `jakarta.jms` 
    javax.{renamed} has been replaced by jakarta.{renamed}
Issue #6:
    Replace the `javax.jms` import statement with `jakarta.jms` 
    javax.{renamed} has been replaced by jakarta.{renamed}
Issue #7:
    
 
 Enterprise Java Beans (EJBs) are not supported in Quarkus. CDI must be used.
 Please replace the `@MessageDriven` annotation with a CDI scope annotation like `@ApplicationScoped`.
 
 
    @MessageDriven - EJBs are not supported in Quarkus
Issue #8:
    
 
 The `destinationLookup` property can be migrated by annotating a message handler method (potentially `onMessage`) with the
 `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` annotation, indicating the name of the queue as a value:
 
 Before:
 ```
 @MessageDriven(name = "HelloWorldQueueMDB", activationConfig = 
 public class MessageListenerImpl implements MessageListener 
 }}
 ```
 
 After:
 ```
 public class MessageListenerImpl implements MessageListener 
 }}
 ```
 
 
    Configure message listener method with @Incoming
Issue #9:
    
 
 The `destinationLookup` property can be migrated by annotating a message handler method (potentially `onMessage`) with the
 `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` annotation, indicating the name of the queue as a value:
 
 Before:
 ```
 @MessageDriven(name = "HelloWorldQueueMDB", activationConfig = 
 public class MessageListenerImpl implements MessageListener 
 }}
 ```
 
 After:
 ```
 public class MessageListenerImpl implements MessageListener 
 }}
 ```
 
 
    Configure message listener method with @Incoming
Issue #10:
    
 
 The `destinationLookup` property can be migrated by annotating a message handler method (potentially `onMessage`) with the
 `org.eclipse.microprofile.reactive.messaging.Incoming` annotation, indicating the name of the queue as a value:

 public class MessageListenerImpl implements MessageListener 
 }}
 ```
 
 After:
 ```
 public class MessageListenerImpl implements MessageListener 
 }}
 ```
 
 
    Configure message listener method with @Incoming
Issue #11:
    
 
 References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.
 
 
    JMS is not supported in Quarkus
Issue #12:
    
 
 References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.
 
 
    JMS is not supported in Quarkus
Issue #13:
    
 
 References to JavaEE/JakartaEE JMS elements should be removed and replaced with their Quarkus SmallRye/Microprofile equivalents.
 
 
    JMS is not supported in Quarkus
Issue #14:
