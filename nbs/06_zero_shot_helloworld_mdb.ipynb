    "# Zero Shot examples with HelloWorld-MDB\n",
    "## Overview\n",
    "We will use 1 sample application for this example.  It has an original branch which represents the starting point as a Java EE application and then another branch for the end result of being migrated to Quarkus.  \n",
    "## What are we doing?\n",
    "* We will experiment with several zero-shot prompts to see what kind of information we can get back from the model.\n",
    "    * We will run this example with 2 models from OpenAI and save the output to disk\n",
    "* What are the prompts we will use:\n",
    "    1. Simple prompt with little added to it beyond the java ee source code and a simple directive\n",
    "    2. A slightly improved prompt in that we direct the LLM to think about the reasoning prior to updating the code\n",
    "    3. An improved prompt that combines issues we identified via our static code analysis\n",
    "## Sample App Information\n",
    "### Hello World MDB\n",
    "* This example started from JBoss EAP Quickstarts: https://github.com/jboss-developer/jboss-eap-quickstarts/tree/7.4.x/helloworld-mdb/src/main/java/org/jboss/as/quickstarts/mdb\n",
    "* Our team then ported 'HelloWorld MDB' to Quarkus:https://github.com/savitharaghunathan/helloworld-mdb/tree/quarkus\n",
    "    * Note these blog posts from prior work of modernizing this same HelloWorld app, the difference with our latest work and the below is the change our team did to also address JMS to Reactive changes:\n",
    "        * https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/11/07/quarkus-modernize-helloworld-jboss-eap-quickstart-part-1#let_s_modernize_helloworld\n",
    "        * https://developers.redhat.com/blog/2019/11/08/quarkus-modernize-helloworld-jboss-eap-quickstart-part-2\n",
    "* We are running some custom rules with this analysis:\n",
    "    * The analysis run via the script [../data/custom_rule_analyze_helloworld.sh](../data/custom_rule_analyze_helloworld.sh)\n",
    "    * We developed rules for JMS -> Reactive here:\n",
    "        * https://github.com/windup/windup-rulesets/pull/1043\n",
    "        * https://github.com/jmle/rulesets/blob/jms-rule/default/generated/quarkus/05-jms-to-reactive-quarkus.windup.yaml\n",
