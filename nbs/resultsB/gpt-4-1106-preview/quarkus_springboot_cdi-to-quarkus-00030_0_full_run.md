# Ruleset Violation: 'quarkus/springboot' 'cdi-to-quarkus-00030'
## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine a code snippet from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be give:
1. The source code snippet to update, 'Source Code to Update'
2. A hint of what needs to be updated via a 'Description' and a 'Message'
3. Optionally, a working example of a diff of a similar problem that was solved which we will call a 'Solved Problem'

## 'Source Code to Update'
Source code filename ``` src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/beans.xml ``` is:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

## Static Code Analysis Information:

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and strongly consider it as an important 
issue we need to address when we rewrite the source code to Quarkus

### 'Description' of the problem: 
```
`beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored
`beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored and it could be removed from the application.. Refer to the guide referenced below to check the supported CDI feature in Quarkus.
```

### 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
```
`beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored and it could be removed from the application.. Refer to the guide referenced below to check the supported CDI feature in Quarkus.
```

### 'Solved Problem'
The 'Solved Problem' will be presented as a diff from a git repo in a branch that has
the solved updates so the application can use Quarkus. Note that the solved problem is 
for a different application to our target application, but the application may have similiarities.
Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present, we want to follow a similar 
pattern adapted to our specific source file.

The filename for the 'Solved Example Problem' is:
```

```

The diff for the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' is:
```

```


## Instructions
Your job is to look at the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' and update it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus.  Use the static code analysis information we share 
here, and study how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Solved Example Problem Diff'
and and determine if a similar pattern can be applied to the 'Source Code to Update'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Source Code to Update' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format as the below:

## Result
```diff
 ...
```

Ensure that you begin the result with the markdown header of: ## Result


## Result:
Based on the static code analysis information provided, the `beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored in Quarkus and can be removed from the application. In Quarkus, the CDI beans are discovered automatically without the need for a `beans.xml` file, unless you want to use it to configure bean discovery modes or interceptors.

Since the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' is not provided, I will proceed with the information given and the knowledge of Quarkus.

In Quarkus, if you want to enable all beans for CDI, you don't need to do anything as this is the default behavior. If you want to restrict the beans that are managed by CDI, you can use the `@ApplicationScoped`, `@RequestScoped`, `@Singleton`, etc., annotations directly in your Java code.

Therefore, the `beans.xml` file can be safely removed from the project. If there are any specific configurations that were done in `beans.xml` that need to be preserved, they would have to be translated into annotations or Quarkus configuration properties.

Here is the diff that shows the removal of the `beans.xml` file:

## Result
```diff
- <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

```

This diff indicates that the entire `beans.xml` file is removed. In a real-world scenario, you would actually delete the file from the project, but for the purpose of this exercise, the diff shows the content being subtracted.

If there were any specific configurations in `beans.xml` that need to be translated to Quarkus configurations, additional steps would be required to ensure those configurations are handled appropriately, either through annotations in the Java code or through `application.properties` settings. However, without specific details on such configurations, no further action can be taken at this point.
