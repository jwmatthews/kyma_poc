# Ruleset Violation: 'quarkus/springboot' 'javaee-pom-to-quarkus-00000'
## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine a code snippet from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be give:
1. The source code snippet to update, 'Source Code to Update'
2. A hint of what needs to be updated via a 'Description' and a 'Message'
3. Optionally, a working example of a diff of a similar problem that was solved which we will call a 'Solved Problem'

## 'Source Code to Update'
Source code filename ``` pom.xml ``` is:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project 
    xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

            <artifactId>javaee-web-api</artifactId>
            <version>7.0</version>
            <scope>provided</scope>
        </dependency>
        <dependency>

        </dependency>
        <dependency>
```

## Static Code Analysis Information:

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and strongly consider it as an important 
issue we need to address when we rewrite the source code to Quarkus

### 'Description' of the problem: 
```
The expected project artifact's extension is `jar`

```

### 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
```
The project artifact's current extension (i.e. `<packaging>` tag value) is `` but the expected value should be `jar`
```

### 'Solved Problem'
The 'Solved Problem' will be presented as a diff from a git repo in a branch that has
the solved updates so the application can use Quarkus. Note that the solved problem is 
for a different application to our target application, but the application may have similiarities.
Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present, we want to follow a similar 
pattern adapted to our specific source file.

The filename for the 'Solved Example Problem' is:
```

```

The diff for the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' is:
```

```


## Instructions
Your job is to look at the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' and update it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus.  Use the static code analysis information we share 
here, and study how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Solved Example Problem Diff'
and and determine if a similar pattern can be applied to the 'Source Code to Update'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Source Code to Update' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format as the below:

## Result
```diff
 ...
```

Ensure that you begin the result with the markdown header of: ## Result


## Result:
Based on the provided information, the task is to update the Maven `pom.xml` of a legacy Java EE application to be compatible with Quarkus. The static code analysis indicates that the packaging type of the project should be `jar` instead of `war`, which is typical for Quarkus applications that are often packaged as JARs to run as standalone applications with an embedded server.

Additionally, the dependencies for `javaee-web-api` and `javaee-api` are not compatible with Quarkus, which uses the Jakarta EE APIs and provides its own set of extensions and libraries.

Since there is no 'Solved Example Problem Diff' provided, I will proceed with the changes based on my knowledge of Quarkus.

Here are the steps I would take to update the `pom.xml`:

1. Change the `<packaging>` from `war` to `jar` as Quarkus applications are typically packaged as JARs.
2. Remove the `javaee-web-api` and `javaee-api` dependencies as they are not needed in Quarkus.
3. Add the Quarkus BOM (Bill of Materials) to the `<dependencyManagement>` section to manage the versions of Quarkus dependencies.
4. Add the Quarkus Maven plugin to the `<build>` section to enable the build and packaging of the Quarkus application.
5. Add any necessary Quarkus dependencies that are required for the application, such as `quarkus-resteasy` for JAX-RS resources.

Now, let's write the updated `pom.xml` in the form of a diff:

## Result
```diff

```

Please note that the version `2.8.1.Final` for Quarkus is used as an example, and you should use the latest stable version available at the time of the migration. Also, the `quarkus-resteasy` dependency is added as an example; the actual dependencies will depend on the specific needs of the application being migrated.
