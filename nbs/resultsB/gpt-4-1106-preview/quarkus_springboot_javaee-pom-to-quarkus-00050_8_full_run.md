# Ruleset Violation: 'quarkus/springboot' 'javaee-pom-to-quarkus-00050'
## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine a code snippet from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be give:
1. The source code snippet to update, 'Source Code to Update'
2. A hint of what needs to be updated via a 'Description' and a 'Message'
3. Optionally, a working example of a diff of a similar problem that was solved which we will call a 'Solved Problem'

## 'Source Code to Update'
Source code filename ``` pom.xml ``` is:
```
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<project 
    xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0" 
    xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:schemaLocation="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0 http://maven.apache.org/xsd/maven-4.0.0.xsd">

```

## Static Code Analysis Information:

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and strongly consider it as an important 
issue we need to address when we rewrite the source code to Quarkus

### 'Description' of the problem: 
```
Adopt Maven Failsafe plugin

```

### 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
```
Use the Maven Failsafe plugin adding the following sections to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <properties>. <surefire-plugin.version>3.0.0</compiler-plugin.version>. </properties>. <build>. <plugins>. <plugin>. <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>. <version>$</version>. <executions>. <execution>. <goals>. <goals>integration-test</goal>. <goals>verify</goal>. </goals>. <configuration>. <systemPropertyVariables>. <native.image.path>$/$-runner</native.image.path>. <java.util.logging.manager>org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</java.util.logging.manager>. <maven.home>$</maven.home>. </systemPropertyVariables>. </configuration>. </execution>. </executions>. </plugin>. </plugins>. </build>. ```
```

### 'Solved Problem'
The 'Solved Problem' will be presented as a diff from a git repo in a branch that has
the solved updates so the application can use Quarkus. Note that the solved problem is 
for a different application to our target application, but the application may have similiarities.
Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present, we want to follow a similar 
pattern adapted to our specific source file.

The filename for the 'Solved Example Problem' is:
```

```

The diff for the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' is:
```

```


## Instructions
Your job is to look at the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' and update it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus.  Use the static code analysis information we share 
here, and study how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Solved Example Problem Diff'
and and determine if a similar pattern can be applied to the 'Source Code to Update'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Source Code to Update' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format as the below:

## Result
```diff
 ...
```

Ensure that you begin the result with the markdown header of: ## Result


## Result:
To update the legacy Java EE application to use Quarkus, we need to make several changes to the `pom.xml` file. The static code analysis tool has highlighted the need to adopt the Maven Failsafe plugin for integration testing. This is important because Quarkus applications often include both unit tests and integration tests, and the Failsafe plugin is designed to handle integration tests, which may require the application to be packaged and deployed in a certain way.

Here are the steps we need to take:

1. Change the packaging type from `war` to `jar` because Quarkus applications are typically packaged as JARs, which can be run using `java -jar`.
2. Remove the Java EE dependencies as Quarkus provides its own set of APIs and does not rely on the full Java EE stack.
3. Add the Quarkus BOM (Bill of Materials) to manage the versions of Quarkus dependencies.
4. Add the Quarkus Maven plugin to build the application.
5. Add the Maven Failsafe plugin as indicated by the static code analysis tool.
6. Configure the Failsafe plugin with the correct version and system properties as required for Quarkus integration testing.

Since we do not have a 'Solved Example Problem Diff' to refer to, we will proceed with the changes based on the information provided and best practices for migrating to Quarkus.

```

Please note that the version numbers for Quarkus and the plugins should be updated to the latest stable versions available at the time of migration. The placeholder for Quarkus dependencies should be replaced with the actual dependencies required by the application.
