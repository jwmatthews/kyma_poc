# Ruleset Violation: 'quarkus/springboot' 'quarkus-flyway-00010'
## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine a code snippet from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be give:
1. The source code snippet to update, 'Source Code to Update'
2. A hint of what needs to be updated via a 'Description' and a 'Message'
3. Optionally, a working example of a diff of a similar problem that was solved which we will call a 'Solved Problem'

## 'Source Code to Update'
Source code filename ``` pom.xml ``` is:
```

    xmlns="http://maven.apache.org/POM/4.0.0"

## Static Code Analysis Information:

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and strongly consider it as an important 
issue we need to address when we rewrite the source code to Quarkus

### 'Description' of the problem: 
```
Replace the 'flyway-core' dependency with Quarkus 'quarkus-flyway' extension
Replace the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency with the Quarkus dependency `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway`. Further information in the link below.
```

### 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
```
Replace the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency with the Quarkus dependency `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway`. Further information in the link below.
```

### 'Solved Problem'
The 'Solved Problem' will be presented as a diff from a git repo in a branch that has
the solved updates so the application can use Quarkus. Note that the solved problem is 
for a different application to our target application, but the application may have similiarities.
Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present, we want to follow a similar 
pattern adapted to our specific source file.

The filename for the 'Solved Example Problem' is:
```

```

The diff for the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' is:
```

```


## Instructions
Your job is to look at the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' and update it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus.  Use the static code analysis information we share 
here, and study how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Solved Example Problem Diff'
and and determine if a similar pattern can be applied to the 'Source Code to Update'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Source Code to Update' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format as the below:

## Result
```diff
 ...
```

Ensure that you begin the result with the markdown header of: ## Result


## Result:
Based on the static code analysis information provided, we need to replace the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency with the Quarkus `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway` extension. However, the provided 'Source Code to Update' snippet does not include the `flyway-core` dependency. It's possible that the dependency is further down in the `pom.xml` file, which is not shown in the snippet.

Since we do not have the full `pom.xml` file, I will assume that the `flyway-core` dependency is indeed present in the full file, and I will show you how to replace it with the Quarkus `quarkus-flyway` extension. If the `flyway-core` dependency is not present, then this change is not necessary.

Additionally, since we are moving to Quarkus, we should also update the Java EE dependencies to use the appropriate Quarkus extensions. The `javaee-web-api` and `javaee-api` dependencies should be replaced with the `quarkus-resteasy` extension, which provides JAX-RS APIs for RESTful services, and any other relevant Quarkus extensions that provide similar functionality to the Java EE APIs used in the application.

Here is how you would update the `pom.xml` to include the Quarkus dependencies:

```

Please note that the version numbers for Quarkus dependencies should be replaced with the actual latest versions at the time of the migration. The `quarkus-resteasy` dependency is added to provide JAX-RS support, which is typically used in Java EE applications for RESTful services. If the application uses other Java EE APIs, corresponding Quarkus extensions should be added as well.

The `packaging` is changed from `war` to `jar` because Quarkus applications are typically packaged as JARs for running as standalone Java applications. Quarkus also supports native compilation, which is not reflected in this snippet but may be considered during the migration process.

The `dependencyManagement` section is added to manage the Quarkus platform BOM (Bill of Materials), which helps to ensure that all Quarkus dependencies are compatible with each other.

This diff assumes that the `flyway-core` dependency is present elsewhere in the `pom.xml` file and that it has been replaced with the `quarkus-flyway` dependency. If the `flyway-core` dependency is not present, the addition of the `quarkus-flyway` dependency may not be necessary unless the application requires database migrations.
