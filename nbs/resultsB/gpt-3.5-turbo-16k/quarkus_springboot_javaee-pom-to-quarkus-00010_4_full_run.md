## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine a code snippet from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be give:
1. The source code snippet to update, 'Source Code to Update'
2. A hint of what needs to be updated via a 'Description' and a 'Message'
3. Optionally, a working example of a diff of a similar problem that was solved which we will call a 'Solved Problem'

## 'Source Code to Update'
Source code filename ``` pom.xml ``` is:
```
None
```

## Static Code Analysis Information:

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and strongly consider it as an important 
issue we need to address when we rewrite the source code to Quarkus

### 'Description' of the problem: 
```
Adopt Quarkus BOM

```

### 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
```
Use the Quarkus BOM to omit the version of the different Quarkus dependencies.. Add the following sections to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <properties>. <quarkus.platform.artifact-id>quarkus-bom</quarkus.platform.artifact-id>. <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus.platform</quarkus.platform.group-id>. <quarkus.platform.version>3.1.0.Final</quarkus.platform.version>. </properties>. <dependencyManagement>. <dependencies>. <dependency>. <groupId>$</groupId>. <artifactId>$</artifactId>. <version>$</version>. <type>pom</type>. <scope>import</scope>. </dependency>. </dependencies>. </dependencyManagement>. ```. Check the latest Quarkus version available from the `Quarkus - Releases` link below.
```

### 'Solved Problem'
The 'Solved Problem' will be presented as a diff from a git repo in a branch that has
the solved updates so the application can use Quarkus. Note that the solved problem is 
for a different application to our target application, but the application may have similiarities.
Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present, we want to follow a similar 
pattern adapted to our specific source file.

The filename for the 'Solved Example Problem' is:
```

```

The diff for the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' is:
```

```


## Instructions
Your job is to look at the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' and update it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus.  Use the static code analysis information we share 
here, and study how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Solved Example Problem Diff'
and and determine if a similar pattern can be applied to the 'Source Code to Update'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Source Code to Update' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
The static code analysis information suggests that we need to adopt the Quarkus BOM in order to omit the version of the different Quarkus dependencies. To do this, we need to add the following sections to the `pom.xml` file:

```xml
<properties>
    <quarkus.platform.artifact-id>quarkus-bom</quarkus.platform.artifact-id>
    <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus.platform</quarkus.platform.group-id>
    <quarkus.platform.version>3.1.0.Final</quarkus.platform.version>
</properties>

<dependencyManagement>
    <dependencies>
        <dependency>
            <groupId>$</groupId>
            <artifactId>$</artifactId>
            <version>$</version>
            <type>pom</type>
            <scope>import</scope>
        </dependency>
    </dependencies>
</dependencyManagement>
```

We should also check the latest Quarkus version available from the Quarkus - Releases link.

Unfortunately, there is no 'Solved Example Problem' or 'Solved Example Problem Diff' provided, so we will have to make the necessary changes based on the static code analysis information.

To update the `pom.xml` file to use Quarkus, we need to add the Quarkus BOM and dependency management sections. Here is the updated code:

```diff
+<properties>
+    <quarkus.platform.artifact-id>quarkus-bom</quarkus.platform.artifact-id>
+    <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus.platform</quarkus.platform.group-id>
+    <quarkus.platform.version>3.1.0.Final</quarkus.platform.version>
+</properties>
+
+<dependencyManagement>
+    <dependencies>
+        <dependency>
+            <groupId>$</groupId>
+            <artifactId>$</artifactId>
+            <version>$</version>
+            <type>pom</type>
+            <scope>import</scope>
+        </dependency>
+    </dependencies>
+</dependencyManagement>
```

In this diff, we added the `<properties>` section with the Quarkus BOM information and the `<dependencyManagement>` section with the Quarkus BOM dependency. This will ensure that the correct versions of the Quarkus dependencies are used in the project.

Please note that without the 'Solved Example Problem' or 'Solved Example Problem Diff', it is difficult to provide a more accurate solution. If there are any specific issues or errors you are facing, please provide more information so that I can assist you further.
