    """ The intent of this class is to help us form several Prompt examples using a single application
        which we have already migrated.  We are using this single application and picking a few 
        violations our analyzer finds and then will construct a few prompt examples to assess the
        quality of response from a LLM

        We are assuming for the sample application that it is:
        - In a single git repo
        - It has 2 branches
            - One of which is the original state (Java EE) and
            - the other is the solved state (Quarkus)

        We will begin with the 'JavaEE' branch and if we find a violation that has
        2 or more incidents we will generate a patch for the first incident and use the
        2nd incident as the 'solved' example.  This is done to simulate what we can
        accomplish in Konveyor when we have access to the entire application portfolio
        whereby we will have a larger number of solved incidents we can find from other
        applications which have been migrated.
