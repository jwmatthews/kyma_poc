# TODOs
* Clearly break out examples where we have a 'solved' incident, right now I see a number of results which lacked a solved example in the prompt.  Perhaps use a different prompt when there is no solved incident available
* Explore generating rules from the LLM walking the diff between initial/solved branches and summarizing/iterating and look to discover common themes in files.
* Use structured data via [pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) for our interaction with the LLM

## NBDev
nbdev is a tool/approach for developing python code in jupyter notebooks and then exporting that to it's own files for later reuse.  We are experimenting with using it to aid prototyping by communicating to others our thinking process as we explore new libraries/code and capturing the interaction/output for later reading

    * Highlights: 
            Some recent approaches use static analysis (Shrivastava et al., 2022; Ding et al., 2022; Pei et al., 2023)
            or retrieval (Zhang et al., 2023) to extract relevant code fragments from the global context. These approaches expand the prompt (Shrivastava et al., 2022; Pei et al., 2023; Zhang et al., 2023) or require architecture modifications (Ding et al., 2022) and additional training (Ding et al., 2022; Pei et al.,
            2023). In comparison, we provide token-level guidance to a frozen LM by invoking static analysis on demand. Our method is complementary to these approaches as they condition the generation by modifying the input to the LM, whereas we apply output-side constraints by reshaping the logits.
