# Prereq

We are currently running against openai.com hosted models. An API Key
from OpenAI.com is required in order to run these examples yourself. We
expect that the shell environment has been configured with the API key
exported. 1. `export OPENAI_API_KEY="myopenaikeyvaluehere"`

## Tip

We are running with the above in our shell config so all of our
terminals/environments inherit this.

## Install

``` sh
pip install kyma_poc
```

## How to use

Fill me in please! Donâ€™t forget code examples:

``` python
1+1
```
