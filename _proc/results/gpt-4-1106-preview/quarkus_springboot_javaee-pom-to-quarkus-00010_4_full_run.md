## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Adopt Quarkus BOM


## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Use the Quarkus BOM to omit the version of the different Quarkus dependencies.. Add the following sections to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <properties>. <quarkus.platform.artifact-id>quarkus-bom</quarkus.platform.artifact-id>. <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus.platform</quarkus.platform.group-id>. <quarkus.platform.version>3.1.0.Final</quarkus.platform.version>. </properties>. <dependencyManagement>. <dependencies>. <dependency>. <groupId>$</groupId>. <artifactId>$</artifactId>. <version>$</version>. <type>pom</type>. <scope>import</scope>. </dependency>. </dependencies>. </dependencyManagement>. ```. Check the latest Quarkus version available from the `Quarkus - Releases` link below.

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Since there is no 'Example Original Source Code' and 'Example Updated Source Code' provided, I will proceed based on the message related to the issue and my knowledge of migrating Java EE applications to Quarkus.

The message indicates that we need to use the Quarkus Bill of Materials (BOM) to manage our Quarkus dependencies. The BOM is a special kind of POM that specifies versions of dependencies so that you donâ€™t have to. By importing the Quarkus BOM in our `pom.xml`, we can omit specifying the version for each Quarkus dependency, ensuring consistency and simplifying dependency management.

Here are the steps we need to take to update the `pom.xml` file:

1. Add the Quarkus platform properties to specify the artifact ID, group ID, and version of the Quarkus BOM.
2. Add a `dependencyManagement` section to import the Quarkus BOM.
3. Ensure that the Quarkus version specified is the latest stable version available. The message suggests using version `3.1.0.Final`, but we should check for the latest version before making the change.

Now, let's write the updated `pom.xml` source code in the form of a diff. Please note that since the 'Current Source Code' is not provided, I will assume that the `pom.xml` file does not contain the necessary Quarkus BOM configuration, and I will add it accordingly.

```diff
+ <properties>
+     <quarkus.platform.artifact-id>quarkus-bom</quarkus.platform.artifact-id>
+     <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus.platform</quarkus.platform.group-id>
+     <quarkus.platform.version>3.1.0.Final</quarkus.platform.version> <!-- Check for the latest version -->
+ </properties>
+
+ <dependencyManagement>
+     <dependencies>
+         <dependency>
+             <groupId>io.quarkus.platform</groupId>
+             <artifactId>quarkus-bom</artifactId>
+             <version>${quarkus.platform.version}</version>
+             <type>pom</type>
+             <scope>import</scope>
+         </dependency>
+     </dependencies>
+ </dependencyManagement>
```

Please replace `3.1.0.Final` with the latest Quarkus version available at the time of the update. You can find the latest version by checking the Quarkus GitHub repository or the Quarkus website.

Remember to review the rest of your `pom.xml` file to remove any version tags from Quarkus dependencies, as they will now be managed by the BOM. If there are any other specific configurations or dependencies in the `pom.xml` that need to be addressed, please provide them, and I can give more detailed instructions.
