## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Adopt Maven Compiler plugin


## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Use the Maven Compiler plugin adding the following sections to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <properties>. <compiler-plugin.version>3.10.1</compiler-plugin.version>. <maven.compiler.release>11</maven.compiler.release>. </properties>. <build>. <plugins>. <plugin>. <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>. <version>$</version>. <configuration>. <compilerArgs>. <arg>-parameters</arg>. </compilerArgs>. </configuration>. </plugin>. </plugins>. </build>. ```

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Since there is no 'Example Original Source Code' and 'Example Updated Source Code' provided, I will proceed with the information given in the 'Message' and apply the necessary changes to the 'Current Source Code' to update it for Quarkus.

The message indicates that we need to add the Maven Compiler plugin to the `pom.xml` file with specific configurations. This is a common requirement for Quarkus applications to ensure that the Java compiler is configured correctly for the Quarkus framework, which often requires Java 11 or higher.

Here are the steps we need to take:

1. Add the properties section to define the version of the Maven Compiler plugin and the Java version to use for compilation.
2. Add the build section with the plugins subsection to include the Maven Compiler plugin.
3. Configure the Maven Compiler plugin with the specified version and add the `<compilerArgs>` section to include the `-parameters` argument, which is necessary for Quarkus to correctly handle CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) and JAX-RS resource methods, among other things.

The `-parameters` argument preserves method parameter names during compilation, which is important for frameworks like Quarkus that rely on reflection.

Since the 'Current Source Code' section is empty, I will provide the necessary additions to a `pom.xml` file that would be typical for a Java EE application being updated to Quarkus.

Here is the updated `pom.xml` in diff format:

```diff
+ <properties>
+     <compiler-plugin.version>3.10.1</compiler-plugin.version>
+     <maven.compiler.release>11</maven.compiler.release>
+ </properties>
+
+ <build>
+     <plugins>
+         <plugin>
+             <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
+             <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
+             <version>${compiler-plugin.version}</version>
+             <configuration>
+                 <release>${maven.compiler.release}</release>
+                 <compilerArgs>
+                     <arg>-parameters</arg>
+                 </compilerArgs>
+             </configuration>
+         </plugin>
+     </plugins>
+ </build>
```

Please note that the `<groupId>` for the Maven Compiler plugin is `org.apache.maven.plugins`, which is typically implied and not always specified in the `pom.xml` file. However, it's good practice to be explicit about it.

By making these changes, the application's `pom.xml` file is now configured to use the Maven Compiler plugin with the correct settings for a Quarkus application. This will ensure that the application is compiled with the correct Java version and with the necessary compiler arguments for Quarkus.
