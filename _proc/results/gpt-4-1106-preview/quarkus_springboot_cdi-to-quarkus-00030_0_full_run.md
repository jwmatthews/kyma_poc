## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: `beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored
`beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored and it could be removed from the application.. Refer to the guide referenced below to check the supported CDI feature in Quarkus.

## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
`beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored and it could be removed from the application.. Refer to the guide referenced below to check the supported CDI feature in Quarkus.

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/beans.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
In the context of migrating a legacy Java EE application to Quarkus, the `beans.xml` file is used to configure CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) behavior. In traditional Java EE, this file might contain bean-discovery modes, interceptors, alternatives, decorators, and other CDI configurations.

However, Quarkus handles CDI differently and aims to simplify configuration by reducing the need for external descriptors like `beans.xml`. Quarkus performs a build-time optimization that includes only the necessary beans, and it often does not require a `beans.xml` file unless you need to customize the CDI behavior.

Given that the static code analysis tool has indicated that the `beans.xml` descriptor content is ignored and could be removed, the most straightforward action would be to delete the `beans.xml` file from the project. This is because Quarkus uses a default bean discovery mode of `annotated`, which only includes beans that have an explicit CDI scope annotation (e.g., `@ApplicationScoped`, `@RequestScoped`, etc.).

If there are specific configurations in the `beans.xml` that need to be preserved, such as enabling alternatives or interceptors, these can be migrated to Quarkus-specific configurations or annotations. However, since the provided `Current Source Code` snippet for `beans.xml` is empty (`None`), it suggests that there are no such configurations to migrate.

Therefore, the update process in this case is simply to remove the `beans.xml` file. Below is the diff showing this change:

```diff
- src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/beans.xml
```

Explanation of the change:
- The `beans.xml` file is removed from the project structure, as it is not needed for Quarkus and its content is ignored.

If there were configurations in `beans.xml` that needed to be migrated, the process would involve translating those configurations into Quarkus annotations or properties. Since there is no content in the provided `beans.xml`, no such translation is necessary.

If you have specific configurations in your `beans.xml` that you believe are necessary for your application, please provide the content, and I can guide you on how to migrate those settings to Quarkus. Otherwise, the removal of the file is the correct course of action.
