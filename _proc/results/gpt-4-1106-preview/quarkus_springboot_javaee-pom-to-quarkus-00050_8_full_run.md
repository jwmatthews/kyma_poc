## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Adopt Maven Failsafe plugin


## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Use the Maven Failsafe plugin adding the following sections to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <properties>. <surefire-plugin.version>3.0.0</compiler-plugin.version>. </properties>. <build>. <plugins>. <plugin>. <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>. <version>$</version>. <executions>. <execution>. <goals>. <goals>integration-test</goal>. <goals>verify</goal>. </goals>. <configuration>. <systemPropertyVariables>. <native.image.path>$/$-runner</native.image.path>. <java.util.logging.manager>org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</java.util.logging.manager>. <maven.home>$</maven.home>. </systemPropertyVariables>. </configuration>. </execution>. </executions>. </plugin>. </plugins>. </build>. ```

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
To update the legacy Java EE application to use Quarkus, we need to integrate the Maven Failsafe plugin into the `pom.xml` file. The Failsafe plugin is used to handle integration tests, which are tests that run against the packaged application. This is particularly important when working with Quarkus, as we may want to run tests against the native executable if we're using GraalVM for native image compilation.

The message from the static code analysis tool indicates that we should add the Maven Failsafe plugin with specific configurations to the `pom.xml` file. Since the 'Current Source Code' section is empty, I will assume that the `pom.xml` file does not contain any configuration for the Maven Failsafe plugin, and we will add it from scratch.

Here are the steps we need to take:

1. Define the version of the Maven Failsafe plugin in the `<properties>` section. This ensures that we can easily manage the plugin version from a single place.
2. Add the Maven Failsafe plugin to the `<plugins>` section within the `<build>` section of the `pom.xml` file.
3. Configure the plugin with the `integration-test` and `verify` goals to be executed during the respective Maven phases.
4. Set up the `<configuration>` section with the necessary system properties. The `native.image.path` property is particularly important for Quarkus as it specifies the path to the native executable, which is used when running integration tests against the native image.
5. Replace placeholders with actual values where necessary (e.g., the version of the Failsafe plugin and the `maven.home` property).

Let's write the updated `pom.xml` source code:

```diff
+ <properties>
+     <surefire-plugin.version>3.0.0</surefire-plugin.version>
+     <failsafe-plugin.version>3.0.0</failsafe-plugin.version> <!-- Assuming version 3.0.0, adjust as needed -->
+ </properties>
+ 
+ <build>
+     <plugins>
+         <plugin>
+             <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
+             <artifactId>maven-failsafe-plugin</artifactId>
+             <version>${failsafe-plugin.version}</version>
+             <executions>
+                 <execution>
+                     <goals>
+                         <goal>integration-test</goal>
+                         <goal>verify</goal>
+                     </goals>
+                     <configuration>
+                         <systemPropertyVariables>
+                             <native.image.path>${project.build.directory}/${project.artifactId}-runner</native.image.path>
+                             <java.util.logging.manager>org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</java.util.logging.manager>
+                             <maven.home>${maven.home}</maven.home>
+                         </systemPropertyVariables>
+                     </configuration>
+                 </execution>
+             </executions>
+         </plugin>
+     </plugins>
+ </build>
```

Please note that the `${maven.home}` property should be set to the Maven installation directory. If Maven is properly set up in the environment, this property might not be necessary. Also, the `native.image.path` assumes that the Quarkus application is configured to build a native executable with the `-runner` suffix. Adjust the path as necessary based on the actual build configuration.

The version `3.0.0` for the Failsafe plugin is an example. You should use the latest stable version that is compatible with Quarkus at the time of the migration.
