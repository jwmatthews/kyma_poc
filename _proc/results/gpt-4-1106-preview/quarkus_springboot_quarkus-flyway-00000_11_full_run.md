## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Replace the 'flyway-core' dependency with Quarkus 'quarkus-flyway' extension
Replace the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency with the Quarkus dependency `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway`. Further information in the link below.

## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Replace the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency with the Quarkus dependency `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway`. Further information in the link below.

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Since the `Current Source Code` section for the `pom.xml` file is empty, I will provide a general explanation of what changes would typically be made to update a Maven `pom.xml` file to replace the `org.flywaydb:flyway-core` dependency with the Quarkus `io.quarkus:quarkus-flyway` extension.

In a Maven `pom.xml` file, dependencies are declared within the `<dependencies>` section. To migrate from a traditional Java EE application to Quarkus, we would need to replace the existing Flyway dependency with the Quarkus Flyway extension. This is because Quarkus extensions are optimized for Quarkus and may provide additional integration and configuration features that are not available in the standard library dependencies.

Here are the steps you would typically follow:

1. Locate the existing Flyway dependency in the `pom.xml` file. It would look something like this:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
    <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
    <version>some-version</version>
</dependency>
```

2. Remove this dependency and replace it with the Quarkus Flyway extension. The Quarkus Flyway extension is added like this:

```xml
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
    <artifactId>quarkus-flyway</artifactId>
</dependency>
```

Note that you do not need to specify a version for the Quarkus extension if you are using the `quarkus-bom` (Bill of Materials) in your `dependencyManagement` section, as it will ensure that you get a version of `quarkus-flyway` that is compatible with the rest of your Quarkus dependencies.

Here is how the `pom.xml` diff might look:

```diff
<dependencies>
-   <dependency>
-       <groupId>org.flywaydb</groupId>
-       <artifactId>flyway-core</artifactId>
-       <version>some-version</version>
-   </dependency>
+   <dependency>
+       <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
+       <artifactId>quarkus-flyway</artifactId>
+   </dependency>
    <!-- ... other dependencies ... -->
</dependencies>
```

If there is a `dependencyManagement` section with the `quarkus-bom`, it should be left as is, since it's already providing a curated list of dependencies for Quarkus applications.

Remember to check the Quarkus documentation for any additional configuration that might be needed in the `application.properties` file or elsewhere to ensure that Flyway is properly set up in your Quarkus application. Quarkus may have different properties or defaults compared to standard Flyway usage.

Without the actual `pom.xml` content, I cannot provide a more specific diff. If you can provide the content of the `pom.xml` file or clarify the existing setup, I could offer a more precise set of instructions.
