## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Adopt Quarkus Maven plugin


## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Use the Quarkus Maven plugin adding the following sections to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <properties>. <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus.platform</quarkus.platform.group-id>. <quarkus.platform.version>3.1.0.Final</quarkus.platform.version>. </properties>. <build>. <plugins>. <plugin>. <groupId>$</groupId>. <artifactId>quarkus-maven-plugin</artifactId>. <version>$</version>. <extensions>true</extensions>. <executions>. <execution>. <goals>. <goal>build</goal>. <goal>generate-code</goal>. <goal>generate-code-tests</goal>. </goals>. </execution>. </executions>. </plugin>. </plugins>. </build>. ```

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Since there is no 'Example Original Source Code' and 'Example Updated Source Code' provided, I will proceed with the information given in the 'Message' and apply the necessary changes to the 'Current Source Code' which is the `pom.xml` file for a Maven project.

The message indicates that we need to add the Quarkus Maven plugin to the `pom.xml` file. This plugin is essential for building Quarkus applications as it handles the compilation and packaging of the application, including the generation of the native executable if needed.

Here are the steps we need to take:

1. Add the Quarkus platform properties to the `<properties>` section of the `pom.xml`. This defines the Quarkus version that the application will use.

2. Add the Quarkus Maven plugin to the `<plugins>` section of the `pom.xml`. This plugin will enable the Quarkus-specific goals such as `build`, `generate-code`, and `generate-code-tests`.

3. Replace the placeholders `$` with the appropriate group ID and version for the Quarkus Maven plugin. The group ID for the Quarkus Maven plugin is `io.quarkus` and the version should match the Quarkus platform version specified in the properties.

Here is the updated `pom.xml` in the form of a diff:

```diff
+ <properties>
+     <quarkus.platform.group-id>io.quarkus.platform</quarkus.platform.group-id>
+     <quarkus.platform.version>3.1.0.Final</quarkus.platform.version>
+ </properties>
+ <build>
+     <plugins>
+         <plugin>
+             <groupId>io.quarkus</groupId>
+             <artifactId>quarkus-maven-plugin</artifactId>
+             <version>3.1.0.Final</version>
+             <extensions>true</extensions>
+             <executions>
+                 <execution>
+                     <goals>
+                         <goal>build</goal>
+                         <goal>generate-code</goal>
+                         <goal>generate-code-tests</goal>
+                     </goals>
+                 </execution>
+             </executions>
+         </plugin>
+     </plugins>
+ </build>
```

Please note that the version `3.1.0.Final` is used as per the message, but you should always check for the latest stable version of Quarkus and use that if it's more recent. The Quarkus platform version and the Quarkus Maven plugin version should typically be the same to ensure compatibility.

By making these changes, the Maven project is now configured to use Quarkus, and the application can be built and run using Quarkus's capabilities.
