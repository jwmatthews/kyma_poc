## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Adopt Maven Surefire plugin


## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Use the Maven Surefire plugin adding the following sections to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <properties>. <surefire-plugin.version>3.0.0</compiler-plugin.version>. </properties>. <build>. <plugins>. <plugin>. <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>. <version>$</version>. <configuration>. <systemPropertyVariables>. <java.util.logging.manager>org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</java.util.logging.manager>. <maven.home>$</maven.home>. </systemPropertyVariables>. </configuration>. </plugin>. </plugins>. </build>. ```

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Since there is no 'Example Original Source Code' and 'Example Updated Source Code' provided, I will proceed with the information given in the 'Message' and apply the necessary changes to the 'Current Source Code' to adopt the Maven Surefire plugin for a Quarkus application.

The Maven Surefire plugin is used during the test phase of the build lifecycle to execute the unit tests of an application. For Quarkus applications, it is important to ensure that the plugin is configured correctly to handle the Quarkus test environment.

Here are the steps I will take to update the `pom.xml` file:

1. Add the `surefire-plugin.version` property to the `<properties>` section to manage the version of the Surefire plugin centrally.
2. Add the `maven-surefire-plugin` to the `<plugins>` section within the `<build>` section.
3. Set the version of the `maven-surefire-plugin` to the version specified in the properties section.
4. Add a `<configuration>` section to the `maven-surefire-plugin` to set system properties required by Quarkus, such as the logging manager and the Maven home directory.

The reason for setting the `java.util.logging.manager` to `org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager` is that Quarkus uses JBoss Log Manager for logging, and this needs to be specified for the tests to run correctly.

Now, let's write the updated `pom.xml` source code in the form of a diff:

```diff
+ <properties>
+     <surefire-plugin.version>3.0.0</surefire-plugin.version>
+ </properties>
+ 
+ <build>
+     <plugins>
+         <plugin>
+             <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
+             <artifactId>maven-surefire-plugin</artifactId>
+             <version>${surefire-plugin.version}</version>
+             <configuration>
+                 <systemPropertyVariables>
+                     <java.util.logging.manager>org.jboss.logmanager.LogManager</java.util.logging.manager>
+                     <maven.home>${maven.home}</maven.home>
+                 </systemPropertyVariables>
+             </configuration>
+         </plugin>
+     </plugins>
+ </build>
```

Please note that the `${maven.home}` placeholder should be replaced with the actual Maven home directory if it is required to be set explicitly. However, in most cases, Maven automatically sets this property, and you might not need to configure it manually.

Also, ensure that the rest of your `pom.xml` is configured correctly for Quarkus, including the Quarkus Maven plugin and any other Quarkus-specific configurations that might be necessary for your application.
