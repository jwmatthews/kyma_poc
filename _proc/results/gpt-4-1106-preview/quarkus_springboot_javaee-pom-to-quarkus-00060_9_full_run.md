## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Add Maven profile to run the Quarkus native build
Leverage a Maven profile to run the Quarkus native build adding the following section to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <profiles>. <profile>. <id>native</id>. <activation>. <property>. <name>native</name>. </property>. </activation>. <properties>. <skipITs>false</skipITs>. <quarkus.package.type>native</quarkus.package.type>. </properties>. </profile>. </profiles>. ```

## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
Leverage a Maven profile to run the Quarkus native build adding the following section to the `pom.xml` file:. ```xml. <profiles>. <profile>. <id>native</id>. <activation>. <property>. <name>native</name>. </property>. </activation>. <properties>. <skipITs>false</skipITs>. <quarkus.package.type>native</quarkus.package.type>. </properties>. </profile>. </profiles>. ```

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
In this task, we are asked to add a Maven profile to the `pom.xml` file of a legacy Java EE application to enable Quarkus native builds. The static code analysis tool has provided us with the exact XML snippet that needs to be added to the `pom.xml` file.

The reason for adding a Maven profile specifically for Quarkus native builds is to allow developers to easily switch between a standard JVM build and a native build without changing the build configuration each time. Native builds compile the application to a native executable, which can improve startup time and reduce memory footprint, but they take longer to build and require different configuration settings.

The provided XML snippet defines a Maven profile with the ID `native`. When this profile is activated (which can be done by passing `-Dnative` to the Maven command), it sets the `quarkus.package.type` property to `native`, which tells Quarkus to perform a native build. It also sets `skipITs` to `false` to ensure that integration tests are not skipped during the build process.

Since the 'Current Source Code' section does not provide any existing `pom.xml` content, I will assume that we are starting with a basic `pom.xml` file that does not contain any profiles related to Quarkus. Therefore, we need to add the provided profile snippet to the `pom.xml` file.

Here is how the updated `pom.xml` file would look with the new profile added:

```diff
+ <profiles>
+   <profile>
+     <id>native</id>
+     <activation>
+       <property>
+         <name>native</name>
+       </property>
+     </activation>
+     <properties>
+       <skipITs>false</skipITs>
+       <quarkus.package.type>native</quarkus.package.type>
+     </properties>
+   </profile>
+ </profiles>
```

This diff shows the addition of the `native` profile to the `pom.xml` file. When this profile is active, it will configure the Quarkus build to produce a native executable.

Please note that the actual `pom.xml` file will contain much more information, including dependencies, build plugins, and other configuration details. The snippet above should be added within the `<project>` root element, typically after the `<dependencies>` section and before the `<build>` section. If there are existing profiles, the new profile should be added alongside them within the `<profiles>` section.
