## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: The expected project artifact's extension is `jar`


## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
The project artifact's current extension (i.e. `<packaging>` tag value) is `` but the expected value should be `jar`

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: pom.xml
```
None
```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
The task at hand is to update the packaging type of a legacy Java EE application to be compatible with Quarkus. Quarkus applications are typically packaged as JAR (Java ARchive) files, which contain all of the necessary components to run the application, including the compiled class files and the application's dependencies.

The message from the static code analysis tool indicates that the current `<packaging>` tag value in the `pom.xml` file is not set to `jar`, which is the expected value for a Quarkus application. However, the 'Current Source Code' section provided does not contain any actual XML content from the `pom.xml` file, which is necessary to make the required changes.

Assuming that the `pom.xml` file has a different packaging type set (for example, `war` for a web application archive), the change needed would be to update the `<packaging>` tag to `jar`. This is because Quarkus applications are typically packaged as a JAR for both JVM mode and native compilation.

Without the actual content of the `pom.xml` file, I cannot provide a precise diff. However, I can illustrate what the change would typically look like:

```diff
<project ...>
  ...
- <packaging>war</packaging> <!-- or any other packaging type -->
+ <packaging>jar</packaging>
  ...
</project>
```

If the `<packaging>` tag is missing altogether, it should be added with the value `jar`:

```diff
<project ...>
  ...
+ <packaging>jar</packaging>
  ...
</project>
```

Please note that the above diffs are based on assumptions since the actual content of the `pom.xml` file was not provided. If the `pom.xml` file is available, I would be able to give a more accurate diff. If there are other specific configurations or dependencies that need to be updated for Quarkus, those would need to be addressed as well.
