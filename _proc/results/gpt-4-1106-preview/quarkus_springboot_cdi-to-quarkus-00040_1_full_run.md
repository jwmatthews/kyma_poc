## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine code snippets from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and may also have an example problem that was solved 
for a similar problem.  If the example problem is present it will contain the original source code 
and then the updated source code. Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present.  

## Here is a description of the problem: Producer annotation no longer required
In Quarkus, you can skip the @Produces annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier... This field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.

## 'Example Original Source Code':
### File name: 
```

```


## 'Example Updated Source Code'
### File name: 
```

```

## 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
In Quarkus, you can skip the @Produces annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier... This field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.

## 'Current Source Code' we need to update to Quarkus:
### File name: src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/utils/Producers.java
```
  1  package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;
  2  
  3  import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
  4  import javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
  5  import java.util.logging.Logger;
  6  
  7  
  8  public class Producers {
  9  
 10      Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());
 11  
 12      @Produces
 13      public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
 14          return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
 15      }
 16  
 17  }

```


Your job is to look at the 'Current Source Code' and updated it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus, the static code analysis information we share 
here, and the studying how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Example Original Source Code'
and see how it was updated to 'Example Updated Source Code', and determine if a similar pattern can 
be applied to the 'Current Sourec Code'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Current Sourec Code' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format, e.g.:

```diff
 ...
```


## Result:
Based on the information provided and the static code analysis tool's message, we need to update the `Producers.java` class to be compatible with Quarkus. The key point here is that Quarkus allows us to skip the `@Produces` annotation if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier.

In the current source code, we have a producer method `produceLog` that uses the `@Produces` annotation to create a `Logger` instance. Since Quarkus supports CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) beans and the `@Produces` annotation is part of CDI, we can refactor this code to use a scope annotation instead.

A common scope annotation we could use is `@ApplicationScoped`, which indicates that a single instance of the bean is shared across the entire application. This is suitable for a logger factory method since loggers are typically singletons.

Here's how we can refactor the code:

1. Import the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation from the `javax.enterprise.context` package.
2. Annotate the `Producers` class with `@ApplicationScoped`.
3. Remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `produceLog` method.
4. Since the `produceLog` method is no longer a producer, we can make it private and rename it to reflect that it's a helper method.
5. Create a public getter method for the `Logger` and annotate it with `@Named` to make it accessible by name in the application.

Let's apply these changes to the source code:

```diff
  1  package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;
  2  
  3 -import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
  4  import javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
  5  import java.util.logging.Logger;
  6 +import javax.enterprise.context.ApplicationScoped;
  7 +import javax.inject.Named;
  8  
  9 +@ApplicationScoped
 10  public class Producers {
 11  
 12      Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());
 13  
 14 -    @Produces
 15 -    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
 16 -        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
 17 -    }
 18 +    private Logger createLogger(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
 19 +        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
 20 +    }
 21 +
 22 +    @Named
 23 +    public Logger getLogger() {
 24 +        // Assuming we want to use the class name of the Producers class for the logger
 25 +        return log;
 26 +    }
 27  
 28  }
```

In the updated code, we've made the following changes:

- Added the `@ApplicationScoped` annotation to the `Producers` class to define its scope.
- Removed the `@Produces` annotation from the `produceLog` method.
- Renamed `produceLog` to `createLogger` and made it private, as it's now a helper method.
- Added a `@Named` public getter method `getLogger` to provide access to the `Logger` instance.

This refactoring should make the `Producers` class compatible with Quarkus, leveraging its CDI capabilities and following the best practices for dependency injection.
