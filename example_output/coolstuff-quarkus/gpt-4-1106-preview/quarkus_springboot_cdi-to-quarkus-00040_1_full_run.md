## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine a code snippet from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be give:
1. The source code snippet to update, 'Source Code to Update'
2. A hint of what needs to be updated via a 'Description' and a 'Message'
3. Optionally, a working example of a diff of a similar problem that was solved which we will call a 'Solved Problem'

## 'Source Code to Update'
Source code filename ``` src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/utils/Producers.java ``` is:
```
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
import javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
import java.util.logging.Logger;


public class Producers {

    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());

    @Produces
    public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
        return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
    }

}

```

## Static Code Analysis Information:

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and strongly consider it as an important 
issue we need to address when we rewrite the source code to Quarkus

### 'Description' of the problem: 
```
Producer annotation no longer required
In Quarkus, you can skip the @Produces annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier... This field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.
```

### 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
```
In Quarkus, you can skip the @Produces annotation completely if the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype or a qualifier... This field could be accessed using a `@Named` getter method instead.
```

### 'Solved Problem'
The 'Solved Problem' will be presented as a diff from a git repo in a branch that has
the solved updates so the application can use Quarkus. Note that the solved problem is 
for a different application to our target application, but the application may have similiarities.
Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present, we want to follow a similar 
pattern adapted to our specific source file.

The filename for the 'Solved Example Problem' is:
```

```

The diff for the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' is:
```

```


## Instructions
Your job is to look at the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' and update it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus.  Use the static code analysis information we share 
here, and study how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Solved Example Problem Diff'
and and determine if a similar pattern can be applied to the 'Source Code to Update'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Source Code to Update' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format as the below:

## Result
```diff
 ...
```

Ensure that you begin the result with the markdown header of: ## Result


## Result:
Based on the static code analysis information provided, we need to address the issue that the `@Produces` annotation is not required in Quarkus when the producer method is annotated with a scope annotation, a stereotype, or a qualifier. Additionally, the analysis suggests that we could use a `@Named` getter method instead.

In Quarkus, CDI beans are automatically discovered and do not require the `@Produces` annotation if they are normal scoped beans. Since the `Logger` instance is a common dependency that might be used across different beans, we can make it a `@Singleton` scoped bean and provide a getter method for it. The `@Singleton` scope indicates that there will be only one instance of the bean in the application, which is suitable for a logger.

We do not have a 'Solved Example Problem Diff' to refer to, so we will proceed with the changes based on the description and message provided by the static code analysis.

Here are the steps for the changes:

1. Remove the `@Produces` annotation from the `produceLog` method.
2. Annotate the `produceLog` method with `@Singleton` to indicate that it is a singleton-scoped bean.
3. Since the `produceLog` method is no longer a producer, we should rename it to reflect its purpose better, such as `getLogger`.
4. Optionally, we can annotate the `getLogger` method with `@Named` to allow it to be accessed by name in EL expressions or other injection points that support the `@Named` qualifier.

Let's write the updated Quarkus source code in the form of a diff:

## Result
```diff
package com.redhat.coolstore.utils;

-import javax.enterprise.inject.Produces;
-import javax.enterprise.inject.spi.InjectionPoint;
+import javax.inject.Singleton;
+import javax.inject.Named;
import java.util.logging.Logger;

public class Producers {

    Logger log = Logger.getLogger(Producers.class.getName());

-   @Produces
-   public Logger produceLog(InjectionPoint injectionPoint) {
-       return Logger.getLogger(injectionPoint.getMember().getDeclaringClass().getName());
-   }
+   @Singleton
+   @Named
+   public Logger getLogger() {
+       return log;
+   }
}
```

In the above diff:

- We removed the `@Produces` annotation and the `InjectionPoint` parameter since we are no longer using a producer method.
- We added the `@Singleton` annotation to indicate that the `Logger` instance is a singleton.
- We renamed the method to `getLogger` to better reflect its purpose.
- We added the `@Named` annotation to allow the `Logger` to be accessed by name, although this is optional and depends on whether the `Logger` is intended to be accessed in this way.

Please note that if the `Logger` is intended to be used with different classes (i.e., different log names for different injection points), this approach would not be suitable as it would provide the same `Logger` instance for all injection points. In such a case, we would need to retain the `InjectionPoint` parameter and find an alternative solution that fits within Quarkus' CDI model.
