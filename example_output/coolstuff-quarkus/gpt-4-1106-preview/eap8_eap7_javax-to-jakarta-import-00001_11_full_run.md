## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine a code snippet from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be give:
1. The source code snippet to update, 'Source Code to Update'
2. A hint of what needs to be updated via a 'Description' and a 'Message'
3. Optionally, a working example of a diff of a similar problem that was solved which we will call a 'Solved Problem'

## 'Source Code to Update'
Source code filename ``` src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/model/InventoryEntity.java ``` is:
```
package com.redhat.coolstore.model;

import java.io.Serializable;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Table;
import javax.persistence.UniqueConstraint;
import javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement;

@Entity
@XmlRootElement
@Table(name = "INVENTORY", uniqueConstraints = @UniqueConstraint(columnNames = "itemId"))
public class InventoryEntity implements Serializable {

	private static final long serialVersionUID = 7526472295622776147L; 

    @Id
    private String itemId;


    @Column
    private String location;


    @Column
    private int quantity;


    @Column
    private String link;

    public InventoryEntity() {

    }

    public String getItemId() {
		return itemId;
	}

	public void setItemId(String itemId) {
		this.itemId = itemId;
	}

	public String getLocation() {
		return location;
	}

	public void setLocation(String location) {
		this.location = location;
	}

	public int getQuantity() {
		return quantity;
	}

	public void setQuantity(int quantity) {
		this.quantity = quantity;
	}

	public String getLink() {
		return link;
	}

	public void setLink(String link) {
		this.link = link;
	}

	@Override
    public String toString() {
        return "InventoryEntity [itemId=" + itemId + ", availability=" + quantity + "/" + location + " link=" + link + "]";
    }
}

```

## Static Code Analysis Information:

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and strongly consider it as an important 
issue we need to address when we rewrite the source code to Quarkus

### 'Description' of the problem: 
```
javax.{renamed} has been replaced by jakarta.{renamed}

```

### 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve
```
Replace the `javax.persistence` import statement with `jakarta.persistence`
```

### 'Solved Problem'
The 'Solved Problem' will be presented as a diff from a git repo in a branch that has
the solved updates so the application can use Quarkus. Note that the solved problem is 
for a different application to our target application, but the application may have similiarities.
Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present, we want to follow a similar 
pattern adapted to our specific source file.

The filename for the 'Solved Example Problem' is:
```
src/main/java/com/redhat/coolstore/model/InventoryEntity.java
```

The diff for the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' is:
```

## Instructions
Your job is to look at the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' and update it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus.  Use the static code analysis information we share 
here, and study how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Solved Example Problem Diff'
and and determine if a similar pattern can be applied to the 'Source Code to Update'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Source Code to Update' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format as the below:

## Result
```diff
 ...
```

Ensure that you begin the result with the markdown header of: ## Result


## Result:
Based on the static code analysis information provided, the issue we need to address is the replacement of `javax.persistence` and `javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement` with their Jakarta EE equivalents, `jakarta.persistence` and `jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement`, respectively. This change is necessary because Quarkus uses Jakarta EE APIs instead of the older Java EE APIs.

The 'Solved Example Problem Diff' shows us exactly how to replace the old Java EE imports with the new Jakarta EE imports. We will follow a similar pattern for the 'Source Code to Update'.

Here are the steps we will take to update the source code:

1. Replace the `javax.persistence.*` imports with `jakarta.persistence.*`.
2. Replace the `javax.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement` import with `jakarta.xml.bind.annotation.XmlRootElement`.

These changes are needed because Quarkus is aligned with Jakarta EE standards, and using the correct package names is essential for the application to work with Quarkus.

Now, let's write the updated Quarkus source code for the 'Source Code to Update' in the form of a diff:

The rest of the class code remains unchanged because the static code analysis did not indicate any other issues, and the changes we made are specific to the imports that are affected by the transition from Java EE to Jakarta EE.
