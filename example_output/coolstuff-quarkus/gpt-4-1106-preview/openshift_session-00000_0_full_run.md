## Prompt:
You are an excellent enterprise architect who has an extensive
background in helping companies rewrite their legacy Java EE applications to 
Quarkus.  Your task is to examine a code snippet from a legacy Java EE application and 
generate correct and proper code changes to update the application to use Quarkus.

You will be give:
1. The source code snippet to update, 'Source Code to Update'
2. A hint of what needs to be updated via a 'Description' and a 'Message'
3. Optionally, a working example of a diff of a similar problem that was solved which we will call a 'Solved Problem'

## 'Source Code to Update'
Source code filename ``` src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml ``` is:
```
<!--suppress ServletWithoutMappingInspection -->
<web-app xmlns="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
         xsi:schemaLocation="http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee http://java.sun.com/xml/ns/javaee/web-app_3_0.xsd"
         version="3.0">
    <distributable />
</web-app>

```

## Static Code Analysis Information:

You will be given information from a static code analysis tool which has assessed the 
Java EE application's suitability for adopting Quarkus and will highlight key issues it has found.

You will examine this analysis information and strongly consider it as an important 
issue we need to address when we rewrite the source code to Quarkus

### 'Description' of the problem: 
```
HTTP session replication (distributable web.xml)
Session replication ensures that client sessions are not disrupted by node failure. Each node in the cluster shares information about ongoing sessions and can take over sessions if another node disappears. In a cloud environment, however, data in the memory of a running container can be wiped out by a restart.. Recommendations. * Review the session replication usage and ensure that it is configured properly.. * Disable HTTP session clustering and accept its implications.. * Re-architect the application so that sessions are stored in a cache backing service or a remote data grid.. A remote data grid has the following benefits:. * The application is more scaleable and elastic.. * The application can survive EAP node failures because a JVM failure does not cause session data loss.. * Session data can be shared by multiple applications.
```

### 'Message' related to the issue we need to solve

### 'Solved Problem'
The 'Solved Problem' will be presented as a diff from a git repo in a branch that has
the solved updates so the application can use Quarkus. Note that the solved problem is 
for a different application to our target application, but the application may have similiarities.
Pay attention to how the example was solved if it is present, we want to follow a similar 
pattern adapted to our specific source file.

The filename for the 'Solved Example Problem' is:
```

```

The diff for the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' is:
```

```


## Instructions
Your job is to look at the 'Solved Example Problem Diff' and update it to work correctly with Quarkus,
following the best information you know of Quarkus.  Use the static code analysis information we share 
here, and study how the prior example was solved if present.  Read the 'Solved Example Problem Diff'
and and determine if a similar pattern can be applied to the 'Source Code to Update'.

Think through the changes you will make and explain each step of the process and why you think it is needed.
If you are unsure of what changes is needed please state you are unsure and ask 
for clarification to help you.

When you are done explaining the reasoning for each change, write the updated 
Quarkus source code for the 'Source Code to Update' in the form of a diff
in Markdown format as the below:

## Result
```diff
 ...
```

Ensure that you begin the result with the markdown header of: ## Result


## Result:
Given the information provided and the task at hand, we need to address the issue of HTTP session replication in the context of migrating a legacy Java EE application to Quarkus. The static code analysis suggests that we should consider disabling HTTP session clustering or re-architect the application to use a cache backing service or a remote data grid.

Quarkus does not support session replication out of the box because it's designed to be stateless and cloud-native. Instead, it encourages the use of externalized session storage when needed.

Since we do not have a 'Solved Example Problem Diff' to refer to, we will proceed based on the best practices for Quarkus and the recommendations from the static code analysis.

Here are the steps we will take to update the source code:

1. Remove the `<distributable />` tag from the `web.xml` file, as it is related to session replication in a traditional Java EE environment, which is not applicable in Quarkus.

2. Since Quarkus encourages stateless applications, we should ensure that the application does not rely on HTTP session state. If the application does need to maintain state, we should consider using a distributed cache like Infinispan or an external session store like Redis.

3. If we decide to use an external session store, we will need to add the appropriate Quarkus extension and configure it accordingly. This would involve adding dependencies to the `pom.xml` and creating configuration properties in the `application.properties` file.

4. We should also review the application code to ensure that it is compatible with a stateless architecture. This might involve refactoring code to avoid using HTTP sessions or to interact with the chosen external session store.

Since we are not making any specific code changes to the application code itself and are only updating the `web.xml` file, the diff will only reflect the removal of the `<distributable />` tag.

## Result
```diff
--- src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
+++ src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml
@@ -2,7 +2,6 @@

          version="3.0">

```

Please note that the actual implementation of an external session store or distributed cache would require additional changes not reflected in this diff, including dependency management and configuration. If the application requires such changes, we would need to review the application code and add the necessary Quarkus extensions and configurations.
