## Result:
To update the 'Current Source Code' to work correctly with Quarkus, we need to replace the Java EE XSD with the Jakarta equivalent and update the version attribute to "3.0".

The current code snippet is using the Java EE XSD version 1.1 in the `beans.xml` file. We need to replace it with the Jakarta XSD version 3.0 and update the version attribute accordingly.

Here are the steps to update the code:

1. Replace `beans_1_1.xsd` with `beans_3_0.xsd` in the `xsi:schemaLocation` attribute.
2. Update the version attribute from `"1.1"` to `"3.0"`.

The updated code snippet will look like this:

```diff
  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

```

By making these changes, we have updated the code to use the Jakarta XSD version 3.0, as required by Quarkus.
