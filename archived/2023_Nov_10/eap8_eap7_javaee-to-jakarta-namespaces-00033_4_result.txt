## Result:
Based on the problem description, we need to replace the `version` attribute value `2.1` with `3.0` in the root tag of the `persistence.xml` file.

To update the `Current Source Code` to work correctly with Quarkus, we can follow the same pattern as the example problem. 

Here is the updated Quarkus source code for the `Current Source Code`:

```diff
--- a/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml
+++ b/src/main/resources/META-INF/persistence.xml
@@ -1,6 +1,6 @@
 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
 <persistence xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence"
-             version="2.1">
+             version="3.0">
     <persistence-unit name="myPersistenceUnit" transaction-type="JTA">
         <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/myDataSource</jta-data-source>
         <properties>
```

Explanation:
- In the `persistence.xml` file, we need to update the `version` attribute value in the root tag from `2.1` to `3.0`.
- The diff shows the changes made to the `Current Source Code` to update the `version` attribute value. The `-` symbol indicates the lines removed, and the `+` symbol indicates the lines added.
