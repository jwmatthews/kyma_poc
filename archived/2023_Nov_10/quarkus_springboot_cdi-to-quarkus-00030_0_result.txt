## Result:
Based on the problem description, it seems that the `beans.xml` descriptor content is being ignored in the current Java EE application and it could be removed from the application when migrating to Quarkus. 

In Quarkus, the `beans.xml` descriptor is not required as it uses a different approach for managing CDI (Contexts and Dependency Injection) features. Quarkus uses annotations and configuration properties to define and configure CDI beans.

To update the current source code to work correctly with Quarkus, we need to remove the `beans.xml` file. 

Here is the updated Quarkus source code for the `Current Source Code`:

```diff
- src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/beans.xml
- None
```

Explanation: 
- The `beans.xml` file is not required in Quarkus as it uses annotations and configuration properties for CDI.
- By removing the `beans.xml` file, we ensure that the descriptor content is not ignored and the application can fully utilize Quarkus' CDI features.

Please note that if there are any specific CDI configurations or features defined in the `beans.xml` file, they will need to be migrated to the appropriate annotations or configuration properties in the Quarkus application.
