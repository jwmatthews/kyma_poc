## Result:
To update the 'Current Source Code' to work correctly with Quarkus, we need to replace the Java EE namespace, schemaLocation, and version with the Jakarta equivalent.

The original namespace is `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` and the Jakarta equivalent is `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee`. We also need to change the schema version number.

Here are the steps to update the code:

1. Replace the namespace `http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/javaee` with `https://jakarta.ee/xml/ns/jakartaee`.
2. Change the schema version number from `beans_1_1.xsd` to the appropriate Jakarta version.

The updated code will look like this:

```

In the updated code, we have replaced the Java EE namespace with the Jakarta equivalent and changed the schema version number to `beans_3_0.xsd`. This ensures that the code is compatible with Quarkus and follows the Jakarta EE standards.
