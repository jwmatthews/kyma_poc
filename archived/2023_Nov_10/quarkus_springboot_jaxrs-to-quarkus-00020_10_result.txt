## Result:
The issue in the current source code is that it is using the `javax.ws.rs` package for JAX-RS annotations, which is not compatible with Quarkus. Quarkus uses the `jakarta.ws.rs` package for JAX-RS annotations.

To update the code to work correctly with Quarkus, we need to replace the `javax.ws.rs` package with `jakarta.ws.rs` in the import statement.

Here is the updated code:

```diff
 1  package com.redhat.coolstore.rest;
 2  
-3  import javax.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
-4  import javax.ws.rs.core.Application;
+3  import jakarta.ws.rs.ApplicationPath;
+4  import jakarta.ws.rs.core.Application;
  
 7  @ApplicationPath("/services")
 8  public class RestApplication extends Application {
 9  
10  }
```

In this diff, we can see that the import statements on lines 3 and 4 have been updated to use `jakarta.ws.rs` instead of `javax.ws.rs`. This change ensures that the JAX-RS annotations are compatible with Quarkus.

By making this change, the code will be updated to work correctly with Quarkus.
