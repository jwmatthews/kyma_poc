## Result:
The issue mentioned in the static code analysis is related to the project artifact's extension. The current extension is not specified in the given information, so it is unclear what the current extension is. However, the expected extension is mentioned as `jar`.

To update the project to work correctly with Quarkus, we need to make sure that the project artifact's extension is set to `jar` in the `pom.xml` file. 

Here is the updated `pom.xml` file with the necessary changes:

```diff
--- pom.xml (original)
+++ pom.xml (updated)

 <project>
   ...
   <modelVersion>4.0.0</modelVersion>
-  <packaging></packaging>
+  <packaging>jar</packaging>
   ...
 </project>
```

In the updated code, we have set the `<packaging>` tag value to `jar` to match the expected project artifact's extension.

By making this change, the project will be configured to generate a `jar` file as the artifact, which is the expected behavior in Quarkus.
