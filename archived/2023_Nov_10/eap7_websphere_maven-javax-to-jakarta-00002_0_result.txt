## Result:
Based on the given information, it seems that we need to update the `pom.xml` file to replace the `javax.activation` dependency with the Jakarta EE dependency `com.sun.activation`.

To update the `pom.xml` file, we need to modify the `<dependencies>` section and replace the existing `javax.activation` dependency with the new `com.sun.activation` dependency.

Here is the updated `pom.xml` file:

```diff
<project>
  ...
  <dependencies>
    ...
-   <dependency>
-     <groupId>javax.activation</groupId>
-     <artifactId>activation</artifactId>
-     <version>1.1.1</version>
-   </dependency>
+   <dependency>
+     <groupId>com.sun.activation</groupId>
+     <artifactId>activation</artifactId>
+     <version>1.1.1</version>
+   </dependency>
    ...
  </dependencies>
  ...
</project>
```

In the updated `pom.xml` file, we have replaced the `javax.activation` dependency with the `com.sun.activation` dependency. The `groupId`, `artifactId`, and `version` have been updated accordingly.

Please note that this is a general solution based on the given information. If there are any specific requirements or constraints, please provide more details for a more accurate solution.
