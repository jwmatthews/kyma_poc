## Result:
The issue here is that the `persistence.xml` file is using the Java EE version of the XML schema, which is not compatible with Quarkus. We need to update the XML schema to the Jakarta version.

To solve this problem, we can follow a similar pattern as the example problem. In the example, the `version` attribute in the root tag was updated from `2.1` to `3.0`. We can apply the same change to the `Current Source Code` to update it to work correctly with Quarkus.

Here is the updated Quarkus source code for the `Current Source Code`:

```diff
  1  <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
- 2  <persistence version="2.1"
+ 2  <persistence version="3.0"
               xmlns="http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
               xsi:schemaLocation="
          http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence
          http://xmlns.jcp.org/xml/ns/persistence/persistence_2_1.xsd">
      <persistence-unit name="primary">
          <jta-data-source>java:jboss/datasources/CoolstoreDS</jta-data-source>
          <properties>
              <property name="javax.persistence.schema-generation.database.action" value="none"/>
              <property name="hibernate.show_sql" value="false" />
          </properties>
      </persistence-unit>
  </persistence>
```

In the diff above, we can see that the `version` attribute in the root tag has been updated from `2.1` to `3.0`. This change ensures that the XML schema used in the `persistence.xml` file is compatible with Quarkus.
